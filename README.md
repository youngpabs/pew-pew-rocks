An 8 week game project discovering openGL and creating a game without an engine. 

This is a project I did for a past University class. It was a solo project I worked on over a 8 week period getting introduced into openGL. I learned a lot about managing my time and how to organize a project as this was both my first game experience as well as my first time creating a personal project. There was a heavy learning curve trying to understand openGL in a self-taught environment class, but by the end of the project course I was happy with what I created within the time constraints! 

When ever I get the time, I would love too add the aspects I didn't have time to finish like:
- Sound
- An Ammo Tracker
- Score Board
- Upgrade Screen with purchasable upgrades
- Fix red outline on asteroids
- Add different style lasers
- Add different style rocks
