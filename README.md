An 8 week game project discovering openGL and creating a game without an engine. 

This is a project I did for a past University class. It was a solo project I worked on over a 8 week period getting introduced into openGL. I learned a lot about managing my time and how to organize a project as this was both my first game experience as well as my first time creating a personal project. There was a heavy learning curve trying to understand openGL in a self-taught environment class, but by the end of the project course I was happy with what I created within the time constraints! 

You have your trusty reticle to aim and mouse button to click in order to protect Earth from rocks headed towards it. 
Asteroids come in waves in and you reload your lasers with the R key. 

When ever I get the time, I would love to add features I didn't have time to finish like:
- Sound
- An Ammo Tracker
- Score Board
- Upgrade Screen with purchasable upgrades
- Fix red outline on asteroids
- Add different style lasers
- Add different style rocks
